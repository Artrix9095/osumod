## Usage for queue owners

### Home Tab

![(i) Pending](http://put.nu/files/JVTQTgd.png)

For each request, click the (i) icon to open a menu where you can set each request to accepted, rejected, nominated, etc.
If you select the "archived" option, the request will be removed from your home page, and moved to the "Archives" tab. This can be useful for decluttering your queue.

### Request Tab

There is an "open/closed" slider here for your convenience, which is not visible to others. You can always submit requests to yourself, even if you're closed. Submitting to yourself bypasses all checks (e.g. cooldown).

### Settings Tab

When logged in and on your own queue, there should be a settings tab. The settings tab has the following options:

- **Open**: Whether the queue is accepting requests. If it's closed, you can still send requests to yourself.
- **Accept M4M requests**: If true, people will have the option to select "M4M" on your request form.
- **Max pending requests**: If the number of pending (not accepted/rejected) requests goes above this number, the queue automatically closes. Set to something large like 9999 if you don't want this
- **Cooldown between requests**: After requesting, a mapper must wait this many days before they can request again. Can set this to 0 if you don't want to enforce a cooldown.
- **Modder Type**: If you select BN, you'll be able to set the status of maps to "nominated". If you select regular modder, you'll just have a "finished" option instead.
- **Gamemodes**: Requests that aren't from the specified gamemode will be automatically rejected.
